# Imgix Take Home Coding Challenge 

We’d like you to build a small frontend application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow a user to create a photography-and-text image like the one above by specifying a line of text and selecting an overlay color to place over the photo. Your application should combine the user inputs, along with the other parameters specified in the example URL above, to create and display an output image back to the user.
We want you to approach this project primarily as an exercise in interface design. As such, you should carefully consider the interaction model from the user’s perspective: what's the best way to organize and present these inputs for the user?

## How to run this locally: 

``` npm install ```

** I did use ```tailwind CSS``` dependency which could be found [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

Once, you have run all the proper installation for all the dependecies, please open a server using ```npm start```. The server should run on localhost:3000 and you should see this:

Change all the different categories and watch your image make changes in real time -- enjoy!
